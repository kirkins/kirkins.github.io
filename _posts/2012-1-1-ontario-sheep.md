# Ontario Sheep
After finishing my summer position at Fanshawe College and doing some freelance work in London I moved to Guelph, Ontario.

In Guelph I found a full-time position as a web developer. My achievements at Ontario Sheep included:

* Converting the organiztion's print magazine to a digital format.
* Improving and regularly updating the organization's website.
* Creating a mobile app which allowed farmers to access current livestock prices on the go.
