# Running Bird: Tizen Watch App

In 2014 I attended a Tizen conference in San Fransisco. I built several apps to experiment with the technology this is one of them.

The concept of the app is that the bird moves faster as you increase your walking/jogging speed. The further you move the more the background changes.
