# College Years

In 2009 I started my college education. I took what is now known as [Interactive Media Design](https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs-and-courses/program/idp3-interactive-media-design/next-year#group_courses),
but at the time was called Multimedia Design & Development. Areas of education included:

* PHP, Javascript, HTML
* Adobe Flash development
* Use of Adobe Suite including photoshop
