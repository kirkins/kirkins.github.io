This project is based on the work of William J. McCann, Horst G. Klein, & Tilbert D. Stegmann in their _book EuroRomCom - The Seven Sieves: How to read all the Romance languages right away_.

These resources are intended for the use of pre-existing knowledge in one Romance language to passively understand written content from another. It contains a collection of word lists which exist in all or several Romance languages, interactive learning activities, and links to external resources.
