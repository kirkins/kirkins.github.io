I've decided to give freelancing on [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) a try. Having worked on a lot of [open-source mini-projects](https://github.com/kirkins?tab=repositories) since my last full-time job. I'm looking for opportunities where I can use my own setup, tools, computer, and preferably from a remote location.

Toptal seems to offer this and has clients from reputable clients like _Airbnb_ & _J.P. Morgan_.

Doing contracting remotely has a variety of benefits including:

* Using the machine & system you've invested time and energy into. This is a big factor for me as I've taken a lot of time in improving my workflow for productivity. Being forced to work on a windows 7 machine can be a big disappointment. _(Note: I'm a huge linux enthusiast)_
* I'm a big advocate of structuring my day around productivity. For example I know my most productive hours are early in the morning or late at night. I try to do my most complex tasks during that time. I'll save more menial tasks for times like around noon where I know my concentration levels might not be as high. I think everyone is going to have their own unique timeline when it comes to this. None the less contract work gives you the freedom and responsibility to optimize your own time, and not have to worry about someone asking you to [help them fix](https://xkcd.com/627/) their windows 7 machine ... again.
* Working on contract also gives you the opportunity to see what kind of technologies several companies are using and adopting. Often comparing alternative methods to a problem used between companies can give you further insights into software engineering.
