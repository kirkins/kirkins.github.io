I've decided to give freelancing on [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) a try. Having worked on a lot of [open-source
mini-projects](https://github.com/kirkins?tab=repositories) since my last full-time job, I'm looking for opportunities where I can use my own setup, tools, computer,
and preferably from a remote location. 

Toptal seems to offer this and has clients from reputable clients like _Airbnb_ & _J.P. Morgan_.

If you're interested in doing a project on contract feel free to contact me directly at [kirkins@gmail.com](mailto:kirkins@gmail.com?Subject=Freelance).
