# Freelancing on Toptal
I've decided to give freelancing on toptal a try. Having worked on a lot of open-source mini-projects since my last full-time
job, I'm looking for opportunities where I can use my own setup, tools, computer, and preferably from a remote location. 

Toptal seems to offer this and has clients from reputable clients like Airbnb & J.P. Morgan.

If you're interested in doing a project on contract feel free to contact me directly at kirkins@gmail.com.
