I've decided to give freelancing on [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) a try. I've recently been working on a lot of [open-source](https://github.com/kirkins?tab=repositories) and direct contracts. I'm now looking for more opportunities where I can use my own setup, tools, computer, and office.

Toptal seems to offers this and has reputable clients like _Airbnb_, _J.P. Morgan_, and _Udemy_. Getting a contract with companies like these and doing a good job can be a huge boost to one's career.

Doing contracting remotely has a variety of work-life benefits including:

* Using the machine and system you've invested time and energy into. This is a big factor for me as I've taken a lot of time in improving my workflow for productivity. Being forced to work on a windows 7 machine can be a big disappointment. _(Note: I'm a huge linux enthusiast)_

* I'm a big advocate of structuring my day around productivity. For example I know my most productive hours are early in the morning or late at night. I try to do my most complex tasks during that time. I'll save some more menial tasks for around noon. I think everyone is going to have their own unique timeline when it comes to this. None the less contract work gives you the freedom and responsibility to optimize your own time, and not have to worry about someone asking you to [fix their windows 7 machine](https://xkcd.com/627/) ... again.

* Working on contract also gives you the opportunity to see what kind of technologies and frameworks companies are using, in contrast to always working in the same system. Comparing alternative methods and architectures can improve your understanding of software engineering and system design.

I'm excited to try this new platform, and will provide a later update on my experience.
