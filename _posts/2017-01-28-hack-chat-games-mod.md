# Hack Chat Games mod

_Switching back and forth between two tabs to play myself at tic-tac-toe using hack chat, an open-source chat application written in node.js._

This is a modification I made to an existing node.js app called hack chat. The mod allows people in the chat room to
challenge each other to tic-tac-toe. All users in room can watch the game live. Multiple games can be played in single
room at the same time.
