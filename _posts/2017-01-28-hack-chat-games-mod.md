[Github Code](https://github.com/kirkins/hack.chat.games)

This is a modification I made to an existing node.js app called hack chat. The mod allows people in the chat room to
challenge each other to tic-tac-toe. All users in room can watch the game live. Multiple games can be played in single
room at the same time.
