# Scan Gift-Cards & Reward Cards for Use on Phone

After writing the Titan Files app I decided I wanted to make another app which would allow me to use 
my Starbucks card on BlackBerry 10, as the official app was only availible on iPhone & Android.
I ended up building something which worked for multiple reward cards.

I have since made the code availible on [github](https://github.com/kirkins/Titan-Wallet).
