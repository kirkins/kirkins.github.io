# Protect your private files with Titan Files for BlackBerry 10

At the end of 2013 I was able to secure a contract to write a native BlackBerry 10 app for encrypting
and hiding senstive files. CrackBerry a popular BlackBerry blog wrote an [article on the app](http://crackberry.com/titan-files-blackberry-10).

I have since made the code availible on [github](https://github.com/kirkins/Titan-Files).
