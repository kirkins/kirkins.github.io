# Two Quick Games

Sloppy Cards is an open-source drinking game managed and hosted using free services (Google Docs & Github Pages)

These are two quick games I made for my cousin. The first is powered by Google Sheets so he could quickly add new cards to
the drinking game without any programming knowledge.

For the second game, opentrivia, we decided to use CSV. The only difference being he would first have to export his data
from Google Sheets to csv and upload it to github. We felt the trade off in time was worth the speed increase as the trivia 
game includes over 50,000 questions.
