# Diaree App

In 2013 I worked with my 2 best friends at the time to develop a mobile application with a complex
back-end, push notifications, website, and apps on 3 platforms.

We originally started the app at a [BlackBerry app development contest](https://developer.blackberry.com/offers/blackberryjamcamp/)
where we ended up winning second place.
