#Granite Apps

At the start of 2013 I left Ontario Sheep and moved to Kitchener, Ontario. The city was known as a tech hub
where I could access some of the countries best minds in regards to software engineering.

Initially my company (e.g. freelancing with a name) focused on what I had done after college, custom Wordpress
development for small businesses. Some of my clients included:

* [UK2Canada Pensions](http://www.uk2canadapensiontransfers.com/)
* [Sober Steering](http://sobersteering.com/)
* lesser known companies no longer in existence

However being so close to BlackBerry HQ I ended up finding several opprotunities to make money developing apps.
At first these apps were built using phonegap a technology which could compile HTML/Javascript as an app.

Later I would become the organizer of the cities BlackBerry Development Group and dive into native application 
development using c++ & QT.
